# Frontend Technical Assessment â€” User Dashboard Application

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is my solution for the Senior Frontend Engineer Technical Assessment.
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a scalable, responsive, and user-focused dashboard using modern frontend technologies.

The application demonstrates my ability to structure a React project professionally, implement clean UI/UX, manage state effectively, and write maintainable TypeScript code â€” along with basic unit testing for key components.
