# Frontend Technical Assessment — User Dashboard Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is my solution for the Senior Frontend Engineer Technical Assessment.
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a scalable, responsive, and user-focused dashboard using modern frontend technologies.

The application demonstrates my ability to structure a React project professionally, implement clean UI/UX, manage state effectively, and write maintainable TypeScript code — along with basic unit testing for key components.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧪 Run Tests

```
npm test
```

## 🎯 Features Implemented

- User Detail (Click a user to view profile picture, name, email, role, status (modal or panel))

- State Management (Proper handling of loading and error states)

### ✅ UI/UX & Architecture

- Component-driven architecture with reusable UI components
